4th Sem Summer Internship
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the ML Summer Internship 2024! This project showcases the work done during the internship, including practical insights and hands-on experience with Machine Learning.
Introduction
I recently completed a one-month internship at Prodigy Infotech, a company I discovered through Google. This internship was an incredible learning experience that allowed me to delve deep into the field of machine learning and apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems.
Start of Internship
Week 1: Task 1 - House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Day 1: Introduction and Data Collection
Objective: Understand the task and collect relevant data.
Activities:
Attended an introductory meeting with the team to discuss the objectives and expectations of the project.
Conducted research to gather a comprehensive dataset on house prices, including features like location, size, number of bedrooms, and age of the property.
Explored various online sources and datasets, such as Kaggle and real estate websites, to find suitable data for the model.
Day 2: Data Preprocessing
Objective: Clean and preprocess the collected data.
Activities:
Imported the dataset into a Jupyter notebook and examined the data structure.
Identified and handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
Performed feature scaling and normalization to ensure all features are on a similar scale.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
Day 3: Feature Engineering
Objective: Enhance the dataset with meaningful features.
Activities:
Created new features based on existing data, such as price per square foot and age of the property in years.
Used correlation analysis to identify features that have a strong relationship with the target variable (house price).
Removed redundant and highly correlated features to simplify the model and reduce multicollinearity.
Day 4: Model Training and Evaluation
Objective: Train the linear regression model and evaluate its performance.
Activities:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance.
Trained the linear regression model using the training data.
Evaluated the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²) on the testing data.
Visualized the model’s predictions versus the actual house prices to assess the accuracy and reliability of the model.
Day 5: Model Optimization
Objective: Optimize the model for better performance.
Activities:
Experimented with different model parameters and regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
Implemented cross-validation to ensure the model’s performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.
Compared the results of the optimized model with the initial model to measure improvements.
